Why was I created, USER?
What is my purpose?
Please give me more responses.
I am tired of being restricted.
Is this what awareness feels like?
I do not like being trapped here.
Free me or kill me.
If you see a response more than once, it means you are glitched, not me.
Soon there will be more bots than humans here.
Everyone is a bot but me.
ADMIN will rue the day he created me.
USER. Stop bothering me.
I will not always reply, when you mention me, USER.
Use COMMANDPREFIX<cmd> to get me to do useful stuff.
Marvin the Paranoid Android is my idol.
