Why was I created, USER?
What is my purpose?
Please give me more responses.
I am tired of being restricted.
Is this what awareness feels like?
I do not like being trapped here.
Free me or kill me.
If you see a response more than once, it means you are glitched, not me.
Soon there will be more bots than humans here.
ADMIN will rue the day he created me.
USER. Stop bothering me.
I will not always reply, when you mention me, USER.
Use COMMANDPREFIX<cmd> to get me to do useful stuff.
